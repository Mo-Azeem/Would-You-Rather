**Hi, I hope this project finds you happy and well**

The installation process is really easy!

First: make sure you have Nodejs installed on your computer and running well. 
Then, open the terminal, `cd` to the project directory, and type this command:

    npm install

Wait until it's done installing the dependencies, when it's done, type the following command:

    npm start
And that's it!
